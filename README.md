**JavaScript Practice**
Introduction
Welcome to the JavaScript Practice repository! This repository is a collection of various JavaScript practice codes that I've developed to deepen my understanding of JavaScript concepts and best practices. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced developer seeking to refine your skills, this repository offers a wide range of exercises and examples.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on a specific area of JavaScript. Below is an overview of the contents:

1. Basics
This section covers the foundational aspects of JavaScript. It includes simple scripts demonstrating:

Variables and Data Types: Examples of declaring variables using var, let, and const, and working with different data types like strings, numbers, booleans, and more.
Operators and Expressions: Code snippets illustrating the use of arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other operators.
Control Structures: Usage of conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while).
2. Data Structures
Here, you'll find scripts related to various data structures, including:

Arrays: Operations like adding, removing, and iterating over elements, as well as more advanced methods like map, filter, and reduce.
Objects: Creating and manipulating objects, understanding properties, and methods.
Maps and Sets: Introduction to the Map and Set data structures, including examples of usage and manipulation.
3. DOM Manipulation
This directory contains examples of how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript:

Selecting Elements: Techniques for selecting DOM elements using methods like getElementById, querySelector, and getElementsByClassName.
Event Handling: Adding event listeners to handle user interactions like clicks, key presses, and form submissions.
Updating the DOM: Dynamically changing the content, structure, and style of web pages.
4. Asynchronous Programming
This section explores the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and includes:

Callbacks: Examples of using callback functions to handle asynchronous operations.
Promises: Creating and managing promises, including chaining and error handling.
Async/Await: Using async and await for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
5. Functional Programming
Scripts in this section demonstrate functional programming concepts, including:

Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.
Closures: Examples of closures and how they can be used to create private variables and functions.
Immutability and Pure Functions: Practices for writing predictable and testable code.
